# Add Free Promoproduct v0.0.1
## for Magento 1.9

This little extension will add a free product depending on the quantity of a "triggerproduct" - A client wanted to have a buy 20 get 1 free thing, with the twist of the free product being an extra item in the cart, instead of solving it via a cart rule.

## TODO
- still need to make some config stuff via system.xml
- make those variables work together nicely with my code
- make a seperate item template for the cart item, so it cannot be deleted or changed in quantity
